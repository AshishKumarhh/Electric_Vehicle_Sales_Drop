*Growth Analyst @ Zoom Electric*

Welcome to the "Quantifying the Sales Drop" project repository. In this project, I conducted an analysis to quantify the drop in sales volume for Sprint Scooters over a specific period. The goal was to validate a 20% sales decline and gain insights into the sales performance of this new product.

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: Validate a 20% drop in Sprint Scooters' sales volume.
- **Method**: Utilized a rolling 7-day cumulative sales volume calculation.
- **Results**: Confirmed a sales decline and identified potential trends affecting sales.
